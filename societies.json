Through a vote at the beginning of the year, we select a number of series to play through each screening and combine them with spectacular movies to make for unique and memorable events. Aside from the screenings, we organise meals out, pub crawls and indulge in karaoke; the other most prominent Japanese export. There are also cosplay parties during the year, where you can dress up as your favorite character (or not) and dance the night away to ear-pleasing J-Pop and J-Rock tunes.

For more than 67 years, Israel has denied Palestinians their basic rights and implemented a system of apartheid and settler-colonialism over the Palestinian people. Israel has stolen land, built Jewish-only settlements, expelled Palestinians or corned them into ghettos, surrounded by walls, military watchtowers and checkpoints. Half of the Palestinian people continue to live outside Palestine as refugees, denied their right of return to their homes, simply because they aren't Jewish. Israel is only able to maintain this system of settler-colonialism and apartheid because of the international support it receives from governments and companies across the world. In 2005, the Palestinian civil society called for the international community to Boycott, Divest and Sanction (BDS) Israel as a non-violent means to pressure Israel into complying with international law and the basic principles of human rights. As students, staff, alumni and funders of the University of Manchester, we refuse to allow the university to support Israel's war crimes and to take a stand and follow their claims of \"Social Responsibility\". We demand that the university stands for peace, and stands in Solidarity with Palestine "

We love to stunt, jump, tumble and cheer on our fellow sports teams at Manchester along with competing at national level competitions.\u00a0We cater for all ability levels. UMC consists of our game day squad who cheer on our fellow Manchester University sports teams (open to anyone, no auditions required) and several competition teams including all girl, co-ed (mixed gender), pom dance, urban cheer\u00a0and stunt teams (try outs required). \u00a0 New to cheerleading? \u00a0 if you\u2019ve never done cheer before don\u2019t let that hold you back! Come and have a go, we know you\u2019ll love it and there will be lots of guys and girls in the same boat as you learning the basics. Even the most skilled cheerleaders have to practice the basics of cheer so our freshers training sessions are a perfect oppertunity to learn the skills required for our try-outs in October 2018! \u00a0 Cheered before? \u00a0 If you\u2019ve done cheer before then you\u2019re in for a treat! The beauty of UMC is that we have cheerleaders of all levels. In May 2018, our Elite squad competed in a stunt group compteition ranging from levels 1-4. Our team founder and coach (who is also a qualified judge with UKCA)\u00a0Kathryn Adamson and Cat Hayward are exprienced level 3, 4, 5& 6 competitors who\u00a0will be sure to push your skills to the next level! \u00a0 How can I get involved? \u00a0 Here at UMC you can choose in what ways you\u2019d like to be involved. For example: \u00a0 - I want to be a UMC cheerleader, but I don\u2019t want to compete \u00a0 If competing isn\u2019t your thing then not to worry. We hold monthly open practices where you can learn\u00a0basic cheer skills as well as different stunts for use at displays and sports matches we cheer at. \u00a0 \u00a0 - I\u2019m only interested in stunting and gymnastics, I don\u2019t want to dance or wave pom poms \u00a0 Do you want to throw people in the air, learn to tumble and learn advanced stunt sequences? Then\u00a0UMC Stunt\u00a0team is the place for you. We focus on pushing our gymnastic skills and undertaking strength training to create jaw dropping stunts. This is not for the faint hearted - stunt team members must be fit, dedicated and strong to pull off our demanding stunt sequences! \u00a0 - I want to do everything UMC related including competitions \u00a0 Our competition squad, UMC Elite, holds try outs in October. We plan to compete at a minimum of three competitions throughout the academic year. If you want to further all aspects of your cheerleading skills, be part of a great team and push yourself with a bunch of like-minded people then Elites is the place for you. In addition, being a part of UMC Elites will assist you if you are interested in becoming a member of the UMC committee in 2019/20. As being involved in all aspects of club helps to build your \u2018UMC CV\u2019 ready for committee elections which take place after the Easter break. \u00a0 Try out information \u00a0 Try outs for our competative squads will be held in October. NO previous experience is required. The most important quality of those trying out for UMC Elite\u00a0is a dedicated and positive attitude. If you\u2019re someone who will be at every training session and will work hard, these qualities will outshine those with higher skills who are less dedicated, so come and have a go! \u00a0 What will I have to do at try outs? \u00a0 Only those who have joined the society and paid their membership fee will be eligible to try out for any of our competition teams. Try outs are made up of five main categories: \u00a0 1) Dance \u00a0 Our Choreographer and Pom Captain Erin will teach you a small section of dance at the practise sessions prior to try outs. Bear in mind the more sessions you attend, the more chances you will have to learn the dance. \u00a0 2) Jumps \u00a0 \u00a0You will be asked to demonstrate some jumps such as a toe touch, pike and hurdler. These will be taught during our Freshers welcome sessions. \u00a0 3) Motions \u00a0 \u00a0You will be asked to perform a short cheer so we can see your cheer motions in action. Again this will be demonstrated at sessions prior to try outs. \u00a0 4) Flexibility \u00a0 You will be asked to show how close you are to left, right and middle splits. You will be asked to show any other stretches you can do such as a heel stretch, scale, scorpion, bridge and bow & arrow. If you can\u2019t do any of these it is not a problem, so don\u2019t let this list put you off coming! You will have plenty of time to learn these skills, we just like to know the flexibility level you are currently working at. \u00a0 5) Tumbling \u00a0 You will be asked to perform a dive forward roll, cartwheel (one handed if you can), handstand and round off. Don\u2019t worry if you have never done gymnastics before, we will take this into account the most important thing is that you are willing to try. Remember you will have the opportunity to learn the basics at fresher\u2019s training. If you have other tumble skills to demonstrate we would like to see a round off back hand spring, backwards and forwards walkovers & a standing tuck back. \u00a0 Most importantly just remember to enjoy yourself! Performing with a smile is a sure way to draw the judges\u2019 attention to your performance! We have chosen people at tryouts with ZERO tumbling ability and undeveloped flexibility because their positive attitude to hard work\u00a0has shone through during training sessions. Don't worry if you\u2019ve not yet got the skills - prove you\u2019re dedicated and you\u2019ll be sure to make a place on the team. GOOD LUCK!  \u00a0 Want to know more? \u00a0 Keep up to date with all things UMC on our facebook page! Just search for the University of Manchester Cheerleaders. You can also check out our website, www.purpleandproud.co.uk, twitter @umc_cheer & Instagram @umc_cheer.

Community organising is democracy in action: winning victories that change lives and transform communities. It's about turning normal citizens - and normal students - into leaders, and turn the world as it is into the world as it should be. We do this by developing an understanding of how power works - and how to bring diverse communities together\u00a0around clear goals and well-researched strategies, to wield people power of their own to transform the world into a more just place. This is politics without parties, this is democracy in action. Last year we won the campaign to get the University of Manchester accredited as the UK's 5000th Living Wage employer - that's right, a student campaigning society that wins! This year we have three campaigns - one focused on-campus, and two branching out into the wider community. We will also be organising training sessions so you can learn the skills to build powerful, winning campaigns. All our campaigns will be sharing a major training day on October 3rd where we will be learning how to build networks for change. Listening Campaign We are launching the University's first Listening Campaign, where we ask students what they think needs to change about our SU, the University, and around the city. This is a great networking opportunity if you're a fresher or living away from halls! #MisogynyISHate We are fighting to get GM Police, and the country at large, to recognise misogyny as hate crime. After our well-attended rally last year and our recent attendance at the national Law Commission review into hate crime, we are continuing to\u00a0network with women's organisations in Manchester to build the power base for this campaign and embark on further actions.

We hope to enrich the quality of life, promote patriotism and welfare and strengthen unity amongst members; the East African community, Swahili speaking community and friends of the Eastern African society. Additionally, we aspire to make all East Africans studying in Manchester active participants in the society.

Providing a forum for discussions about important issues related to our countries of origin and to promote their positive values and culture. Providing opportunities for networking and social interaction.  \u00a0 Our vision is to disintergrate counterproductive walls of isolation. The more people that cooperate with one another, the greater the development in worldwide technology, culture, wealth, and overall well-being. Today, to be a citizen of the world is to be open-minded toward all cultures, nations, and beliefs, a concept that is now almost a standard and is highly beneficial to the human mind. We therefore seek to unite our members and instil a virtue of togetherness between themselves and other global citizens. The core functions of our society include; organizing social activities, promoting our traditions and culture and promoting East Africa as a personal investment destination. \u00a0 How do we aim to do this? In furtherance of the objectives, the society stages talent shows and competitions for the promotion of East African culture and integration in general. Additional support and focus is being given to the promotion of social activities through fundraising techniques that subsidise our operational costs such as membership fees. Our future projects wil include environmental and sustainable energy aspects such as tree planting to promote ethical awareness amongst our members to inspire service in the public interest. We will also assist in the academic purpose of being in University by organising group study sessions in the library to increase the morale of our members. \u00a0 Where do we see ourselves in 3-5 years' time?

These films will be permanently\u00a0showcased\u00a0online through our YouTube channel, will be attachable to the\u00a0portfolios\u00a0of everyone involved, with respect to their role in the production, and eventually offered up for\u00a0competition/festival submission by using the channels available to the society.

This means we can use the college\u2019s network to bring to you the best associated with the speciality.\u00a0  The need for medical students to be interested in general practice cannot be emphasised enough. A latest report in June 2014 by \u2018Pulsetoday\u2019 revealed that the number of GPs are down by 3% since 2009. Another report by them quoted that the number of medical students wanting to be GPs in 2013 was just 28% whereas 50% of registrar posts are for GP training.  We aim to remove the stigmas surrounding general practice and rectify this as a back-up career mentality. Not only do we want to attract more students towards the speciality but we also want to provide a platform for students who are currently interested in the speciality to get the best careers advice and have their questions answered.\u00a0  Some of the proposed ideas for events include, but not limited to: inviting GPs with a special interest to talk through how they got to where they are and what their job entails, inviting GPs to talk through the implementation of the health and social care act 2012 and the role of the clinical commissioning groups as this remains a mystery for a lot of medical students. We also hope to put on some more interactive sessions such as discussions regarding ethical dilemmas faced by GPs in daily practice or NHS budget management.

This includes assisting a nurse-led clinic at a local homeless drop-in centre, but also directing people to the numerous other voluntary services in Manchester. \u00a0 Improve: We are trying to change attitudes towards homelessness for all current and future healthcare staff.

        "name": "Hyperloop Manchester",
        "description": "What is Hyperloop? The\u00a0Hyperloop\u00a0is a proposed high-speed transportation system in which specialized pods are accelerated through a low-pressure tube to achieve speeds near the speed of sound. The system is intended to provide a more cost-effective and faster mode of travel between cities separated by distances less than approximately nine hundred miles. First conceptualized in 2012 by\u00a0Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur leading numerous high-profile companies including\u00a0SpaceX\u00a0and\u00a0Tesla Motors, hypothetical benefits of the Hyperloop include immunity to weather, lack of crashes, rapid speed, low power requirements, and energy generation for its operation. \u00a0 The theoretical transportation system we call Hyperloop would transport people-filled pods or cargo-filled pods over long distances through steel tubes. Magnetic levitation and big vacuum pumps would do away with pesky friction and air resistance, letting those bus-sized vehicles zip along at speeds. It wouldn\u2019t just be fast, Hyperloop could be cheaper and better for the environment than the planes, trains, and cars. \u00a0 Three variations of the exterior design are currently being explored for vehicle pods. One pod design uses air bearings; this design relies on a system to create a bed of air for the pod to glide upon and is the basis of Elon Musk\u2019s original Hyperloop idea.\u00a0Another pod design uses magnetic levitation; this design was used by the winner of the \u201cBest Overall Design Award\u201d.\u00a0The third design uses high-speed wheels for speeds under 100\u00a0mph and air bearings for higher speeds \u00a0 \u00a0 Info about the Competition? The SpaceX tube track, enclosing an almost total vacuum, will eliminate air resistance. Sophisticated electronics and programming have been designed to ensure a stable ride.\u00a0SpaceX announced the Hyperloop Pod Competition in 2015. The competition\u2019s goal is to support the development of functional prototypes and encourage innovation by challenging student teams to design and build the best high-speed Pod. The first three competitions were held on January 2017, August 2017, and July 2018, and were the first of their kind anywhere in the world. \u00a0 How to recruit students to our team? There will be an online registration form demanding students\u2019 major, interests in Hyperloop, and their resume. Also, an interview will be made with candidate students. \u00a0 Schools that we prioritize for application: MACE,\u00a0Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Physics, Computer\u00a0Science\u00a0and Software Engineering, Business and Management, Industrial Design \u00a0 How many students would compete in the team? Our team will be up to 40 team members. Hyperloop teams don\u2019t include many people. The team will be divided into sub-teams. \u00a0 What funding would we need? Business and management sub-team is responsible to find appropriate sponsorships and funding. We mainly expect to be funded from the University and sponsors. \u00a0 The purpose? As the UoM students, we want to contribute our ideas by building a small-scaled Hyperloop model and highlight the name of the UoM in this important project. To do so, we would like to compete in the Hyperloop Competitions. \u00a0 Contact: E-mail: hyperloopmanchester@gmail.com hyperloopmanchester@outlook.com Website:\u00a0https://www.hyperloopmanchester.com/ LinkedIn:\u00a0https://www.linkedin.com/company/hyperloop-manchester Facebook:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/groups/479330085952236/ "

If they are found to be a match for a patient\u00a0throughout time on the register,\u00a0they could save their life!  VOLUNTEERS - There will be several volunteer training sessions held throughout the year so if you would like to be a volunteer, like this page, and our\u00a0other social media accoutns\u00a0to keep updated. Our\u00a0recruitment events\u00a0are run by volunteers so we need as many as we can!\u00a0   Being\u00a0a volunteer will involve: talking to people about why they should sign up to the register; what donation involves if they are ever found to be a match;\u00a0checking medical backgrounds for donor eligibility;\u00a0 giving the potential donor a cheek swab for us to send off to Anthony Nolan;\u00a0 and assissting them in filling out an application form.\u00a0Certificates are awarded for volunteer of the month as well as Bronze, Silver and Gold Awards for the number of hours volunteered- so it's great for improving your portfolio.  The more people we have, the bigger difference we can make. So please spread the word. ONE OF THE PEOPLE YOU SIGN UP COULD GO ON TO SAVE A LIFE!  Marrow Manchester also hosts fundraising events\u00a0to help\u00a0raise the charitable funds needed to keep the register going- these are always great fun for our volunteers to\u00a0attend.

Our weekly socials are on Thursday evenings and we also have camps and other activites throughout the year.  (after racing to put up our tents, we discovered that they are lot bigger than 3-man!) Who Are We? SSAGO is a national organisation of university students who want to be involved, or continue to be involved, in scouting and guiding. We are the Manchester branch. Many of our members have been scouts or guides, although this is not necessary, and wanted to continue doing fun activities such as camps, bonfires, pudding crawls, climbing etc. We can also help you volunteer locally with scout and guide groups if you are interested.\u00a0  (last year's ball was in Bristol and we all got dressed up on a wizarding theme!) What Do We Do? We are mainly a social group, meeting on every Thursday evening for a social, which can be any of a wide range of activities (bowling, hiking, eating puddings, cooking challenges, craft evenings, eating cheese (and maybe drinking a little wine), ice skating,\u00a0 and the occasional campfire), always somewhere around the union and easy to get to (either meeting in town, at the union, or at one of the nearby Scout huts). In addition, we often go camping. Sometimes this is camps that we organise ourselves, including Freshers camp in October and our week long summer camp (for difficult to explain reasons called Expo) just after exams in June, along with some others throughout the year. We also go on rallies, which are camps organised by national SSAGO and attended by all the student Scouts and Guides in the country. There are three of these each year, in November (which this year will be hosted in Lancaster, on a fantasy theme), February (hosted this year by Nottingham, with a outlaws theme) and June (just after Expo, and this year hosted by Edingburg).  (a traditional scouty exploit) National SSAGO also organises a ball each year. This year Aberystwyth is hosting an ABBA (Aber does Abba) ball. ManSSAGO also has\u00a0a\u00a0Christmas meal, which is another social highlight of the year. Finally, we are involved in other volunteering and fundraising events, both with our connections with the Scout and Guide Associations and on our own. So, if any of this sounds like the kind of thing that you are interested in, then you should join our society.  (enjoying our desserts on last year's annual pudding crawl) How you can find out more You can join us here on the Union website. This will add you to our mailing list, so you should hear about our weekly socials. Membership is not required until later in the year.\u00a0 You can visit our\u00a0National SSAGO page, which should have details of our club, a load of photos of us, and some other useful information. You can join our Facebook group\u00a0for details of our weekly meetings.\u00a0 You can also follow us on Twitter, @manssago,\u00a0Tweets by @manSSAGO  \u00a0 If you want to volunteer with the Scouts, you can email our Scout Liaison\u00a0officer.

Our weekly screenings feature an introduction to the film by one of the committee or particularly enthusiastic member, the screening of the film, and then a discussion of the film. Our informal discussions focus on how we as the audience reacted to the film, looking at the impact of the direction, acting, cinematography, editing, sound etc. We love to hear everyone's opinion, and there is no wrong answer! You don't have to talk if you don't want to, we pride ourselves on being a very chilled society :) \u00a0 We also take regular trips to local cinemas, including AMC, Odeon, and Manchester's key independent cinema HOME. \u00a0 Our monthly film-based pub quizzes are an excellent way for our members to meet new people while having film-based fun! All drinks are bought from the SU bar, so there is no pressure to drink alcohol if you don't want to. \u00a0 All the rooms we use have disabled access, and please let one of us know if you need any extra assistance and we will try to be as accomodating as possible :) \u00a0 We have excellent links with both the Filmmaking society and the film section of the Mancunion, so there is lots of opportunity for creativity surrounding film. \u00a0 Our membership is only \u00a32 a year, and the money goes towards subsidising food for our screenings, advertising costs, and (hopefully!**) subsidising cinema screenings. **Dependent on our financial situation as decided by the committee.

The University of Manchester Optometry Society is for all Optometry students studying at the University of Manchester, however students from other courses in the university are also welcome to join.\u00a0 What does the Optometry Society do?\u00a0 We as a society aim to support all Optometry students studying at the University. Whether that be peer support, putting on social events or relaying feedback to staff about the course. We are here to help make your experience at the University enjoyable and memorable.\u00a0 The committee are all student volunteers who are passionate in doing their best to make sure students are content with their life at university. We have a wide range of resources and are happy to talk and signpost you to university services that may be beneficial, if required. Many students in the past have, at times, found studying Optometry at Manchester intense and overwhelming. We aim to put on events that can help students unwind, relax and maintain a good work-life balance. On the course, it is likely that you only get to know people in your Optometric Examination (OE) groups, Dispensing groups or maybe at lectures. A lot of students want to meet other people on the course but due to this reason, find it difficult to do so. We therefore aim to put on a wide range of events for members, in all years, to socialise. You\u2019ll be able to meet other people on your course (and even in other years) that you may not normally meet or get to know. Some students have felt nervous coming to society events, especially if they don\u2019t typically attend events or are not part of a social group that does. Members of the committee will be at events to support you and make you feel welcome, we want you to be comfortable attending, a lot of people are in similar positions and so are usually more than willing to socialise and make new friends, even in third year! What events do you put on? We organise a wide variety of social events, from going on nights out in Manchester to non-alcoholic socials such as film nights, bowling, eating out in restaurants and of course the Eyeball! We aim to make all our events fully accessible and inclusive.\u00a0 If you are an international, postgraduate or a mature student or identify at LGBTQIA+, you are more than welcome to join! All our\u00a0events are aimed to be welcoming and inclusive.\u00a0We have students coming to events who have\u00a0different cultural backgrounds, ethnicities,\u00a0sexuality, gender identity,\u00a0age\u00a0and who are in different\u00a0stages in university,\u00a0there really\u00a0is a mix! We also have had students attend who were redoing the year or are on interruption\u00a0(taken a break from university). It can be difficult taking a break or returning to uni and suddenly continuing your studies with new people. The OpSoc events have been hugely beneficial with students in this position\u00a0being able to socialise and make new friends. You are welcome\u00a0to attend even if you're currently on interuption.\u00a0We as a committee will do everything we can to support you, if you need it :) Overall OpSoc is what you make it!\u00a0The more people that come and engage in the events, the better it will be for you! Is there a membership fee? We are part of the University of Manchester Student's union and are a non-profit society.\u00a0Everyone on the committee volunteers their time to help oversee and run events.In order for us to put on these events and run the society as a whole, we do\u00a0charge a membership fee.\u00a0We understand, especially as students, this is not ideal but we have to do this in order for us to put on events and run the society to a high standard. We have two membership choices:\u00a01 or\u00a03 years. If you are interested and would like to find out more information, please click on the \u201cJoin Group\u201d button above.

Many students\u00a0find Optometry intense and stressful\u00a0at times.\u00a0The group is there for anyone\u00a0from any year\u00a0who needs it, you can come at any time to just vent/talk and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re late.

        "description": "Scalpel\u00a0is the University of Manchester\u2019s Surgical Society, which represents and hopes to further medical student interest in surgery, and a partner of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. \u00a0 Scalpel was originally formed in 2001, but it was not until 2006 that a core group of Manchester medical students re-formed the society under guidance from the Royal College of Surgeons, creating Scalpel as we know it today. Since this re-invention of itself, Scalpel has gone from strength to strength and currently has approximately 900 members. \u00a0 As an undergraduate surgical society, Scalpel has three key aims: \u00a0  To organise events that showcase surgery and all of its specialties, To excite and enthuse students about surgery, To provide students who are interested in surgery with relevant careers information and advice.  \u00a0 Scalpel hopes to achieve these aims by organising talks and workshops delivered by charismatic surgeons from each and every surgical specialty. We want to get students excited about surgery early on so that they can start to consider whether they want to choose surgery as a career. With\u00a0competition for surgical jobs\u00a0becoming more and more fierce, students are being forced to consider their career options earlier than ever before.\u00a0Therefore students hoping for a career in surgery must start to think about how to make themselves more competitive and Scalpel hopes to help these students by organising surgical careers events and by providing students with surgical role models. \u00a0 Scalpel also seeks to encourage students from minorities into surgery, whether those minorities are ethnic, gender or otherwise by inviting role models from all walks of life as speakers at Scalpel events. Women in Surgery (WinS) events are a frequent feature of Scalpels events calendar, and a diverse range of speakers ensures the calendar remains of a high calibre and continues to be interesting and relevant. \u00a0 In 2009 Scalpel held their first ever\u00a0national conference\u00a0providing delegates with the opportunity to present their case reports and original research to an audience of esteemed clinicians and students. The conference proved to be a resounding success and it has now become a major annual event which is attended by medical students from\u00a0all across the UK and beyond. \u00a0 We are delighted by your interest in our work and look forward to meeting you! \u00a0 Make sure you check our website for more details about us;\u00a0like us on facebook and follow us on twitter to keep up to date with all our events.

We are part of a network of 35 university groups across the country with this same vision.\u00a0 Within this society there is the opportunity to meet individuals from a myriad of cultures whose presence here is testament to their determination to hold strong to their values and flee unwarranted persecution. Joining this society will open your eyes to the hardships people undergo and the surprising barriers to integration into our society. Asylum seekers are especially vulnerable to discrimination and mental unrest due to their precarious status until proclaimed refugees. As STAR members we strive to make this country and this city as welcoming as possible and support the campaigns to change attitudes within government, media as well as the British people towards asylum seekers. Destitution, detention and barriers to higher education for asylum seekers are just a few of the consequences of policies and negative attitudes. Volunteering We run two conversation clubs to help refugees and asylum seekers to improve their English. These take place in Stockport, on a Saturday morning, and in central Manchester, during the week (TBC). Campaigning Last year, we successfully campaigned with the Still Human Still Here network by sleeping out against destitution. Two weeks later, Manchester City Council unanimously passed a motion against destitution. This year, building on past campaigns, we will be campaigning for Equal Access to higher education for asylum seekers. We will be asking the University of Manchester to create two fully funded scholarships for asylum seekers.

Watch our videos of students who have been through the process and secured: Work experience, internships and graduate jobs and be inspired! We aim to educate, motivate and inspire\u00a0students\u00a0to start thinking about their career and start working towards it by creating informal videos by students who have been through the process and secured internships, apprenticeships, graduate jobs, societies, exchange programmes, startups or any work experience. We want to help students currently trying to achieve their goals to feel motivated, inspired and educated to take action. The idea is to create inspiration FOR students\u00a0BY students.  Current ONS statistics show that over 65% of 16-25 year olds do not know what they want to do in life. As well as other factors, we believe that lack of tangible, relatable information on careers is unavailable, and if available, it is usually tied up in lengthy online articles and other written pieces that often make relevant information too difficult to be accessible. We believe that in order to help OUR generation, we must adapt to changes in technology and be in line with how our generation consumes information. This is mainly through short snappy informal videos on social media. \u00a0 WANT TO FEATURE IN ONE OF OUR VIDEOS? Have you been through the process and secured: Work experience, internships or a grad job? Want to improve your personal brand? Share you story and inspire others! Drop us a message on our Facebook page, DM us on twitter or send an email to Mils@studentInspireNetwork.com and we'll arrange a place and time to record. INSPIRE SESSIONS We organise networking events with employers ranging from Banking and Finance to Marketing and Advertising. This gives from all degreee disciplines an opportunities to find out more about the opportunities these employers offer and ask questions about applying and securing internship and graduate positions. These sessions will allow you to find out exactly what these employers look for in students and give you the best opportunity for success when applying. \u00a0 Keep an eye on your email, we'll soon send you an invite to sign up to our website where you'll have access to all our videos and all the information on how to feature in one of our videos. \u00a0 Follow us on social media!

At the end of the academic year we will hold a charity art sale where students can create their own merchandise like t-shirts, prints and other bits and bobs, as well as a collaborative year-end, mini art book to commemorate one years worth of hard work! \u00a0 It might sound like a lot, but participation is totally optional, especially if you want to participate in only one of these events.  At the end of the day, all\u2019s good as long as you\u2019re having fun!  \u00a0 Membership: We charge a small membership fee, but don\u2019t let that turn you away! The benefits you get is\u00a0access to our communal art  supplies (which we use this membership fees\u00a0to buy, so the more members, the better the supplies :9) and also discounts  to all the workshops that will be held over the year.

The Big Change campaign promotes alternative giving , encouraging the public to give to The Big Change fund rather than directly to beggars on the street. This is because giving money to beggars on the street often worsens the issue, and makes it harder for charities to form relationships.  Therefore The Big Change society wants to get students involved in working to end homelessness in the long run, rather than replicating\u00a0services already available. We want to encourage students to work to address the long-term issues, filling gaps rather than replicating existing services. Therefore we have four objectives as a society:  1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0To fundraise for The Big Change campaign,  2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0To signpost students towards the best ways they can get involved with ending homelessness  3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0To campaign to raise awareness about areas causing homelessness, e.g housing issues,  4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0To promote responsible giving amongst students Join the Facebook group:\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/thebigchangesociety/ "

Students can join us for only \u00a31.00,\u00a0and learn all the languages we have for free once you are a member! We aim to conduct classes in demand twice a month, and our primary means of communication is via Facebook. Once you become a member, please send a screenshot of your membership confirmation email to https://www.facebook.com/LanguageSoc/. Then, send a request to join our closed Facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/langsocmembers/). If your name on the student system\u00a0is different to your Facebook name, please let us know.\u00a0 Currently, our language bank consists of the following languages, Arabic, Cantonese, French, Danish, German, Greek, Hindi, Urdu, Japanese, Malay, Mandarin, Polish, Portugese, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Korean, Russian! For further enquiries or reporting, please send us a message at https://www.facebook.com/LanguageSoc/ "

Aswell as the A team, the B and C team race in the intermidiates class and is a fantastic way to gain experience of high level karting. Northern Karting Challenge (NKC): The NKC is a championship held at Northern tracks by local unis, these are held in hire karts which is a good stepping stone between indoor karts and the BUKC rotax karts.
